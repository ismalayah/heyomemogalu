Tolkien was first and foremost fascinated with the construction of languages. In fact, one could argue that <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings</a> </strong>originally started as a figment of the lore the British author was trying to come up with for his new language. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>But now that the fictional world is making a comeback to live-action through Amazon’s The Rings of Power series, Quenya and Sindarin will also find further footing on the lips of the Elves of the Second Age. Discussing the difference between the divine Elven speech and its sharp contrast with the Orcs in a recent chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Inverse</a>, here’s what the show’s dialect coach, Leith McPherson, had to say on the matter.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>In her words, Quenya, the language of the Elves, is lyrical and beautiful, whereas Orcish is designed in a way to be “an affront to the listener.”</p><p>“It should feel awful to speak and to hear,” she said. “It’s guttural. It’s harsh. It’s full of rough consonants. All language is a physical act upon the listener. Elvish is a beautiful experience. Orcish is awful.”</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>The first Orcs were bred out of corrupt Elves by Morgoth the Black Foe. It only stands to reason, then, that their language should also have the opposite effect on anyone unfortunate enough to catch a sound of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lord-of-the-rings-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lord-of-the-rings2-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>As for the Dwarves, who not only feature in The Rings of Power but have a prominent role to play in the narrative, McPherson compares their language to the lively quality of day-to-day sentience.</p><p>“These are people connected to the Earth, to stone in particular. It evokes their very solid present. It’s beautiful but there is a rougher quality, a feeling of weight.”</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=false>We have a feeling that we’ll be able to observe these subtle differences for ourselves when The Rings of Power premieres in September. What’s more, McPherson worked with Peter Jackson on The Hobbit trilogy as well, so the language of the Elves will have a ring of fond familiarity to them <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">besides their faithfulness to Tolkien’s work</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXae2r7PSZqafZaCkxKa%2BjJ2gmqSVmMFur86amqFlla29ra3Ip6pmrJiaeqW1xZ%2Bcq52emLJursStrp6dnmKyrcLIrJ9mmZ6ZerC%2BwqKqoWWclruowcCgnKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-mcdonald-biography-wiki-age-height-wife-that-70s-show-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin McDonald Biography, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, That 70s Show, Movies, TV Shows, and Net Worth</span></a>
