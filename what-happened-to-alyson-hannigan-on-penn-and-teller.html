She appeared in the 1999 hit American Pie and its 2001 sequel, among other films.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>She had a longstanding role in the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the classic sitcom How I Met Your Mother as well. She joined Penn & Teller: Fool Us in 2011.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>She joined the show in its third season, replacing Jonathan Ross. At the time, she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that she and her eldest daughter were “huge fans of the show.”</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>“Not to mention, Penn & Teller are genius entertainers, so any opportunity to work with them is amazing.

The truth of the matter is we just don’t know. It could be for a number of reasons. Maybe producers wanted to freshen things up. Maybe Hannigan simply wanted to try something new. It could’ve been a contract dispute.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>There hasn’t been any rumors about a break up or contention between Hannigan and the hosts, so it simply may be that the time came for her to move on.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Others speculate</a> that as Hannigan grew older, the show’s producers felt they needed someone “more attractive” to take over.
