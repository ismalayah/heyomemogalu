Many investigations were done, and his parents reported a Brandon missing case to the Lynd Police.</p><p>Moreover, the investigators also searched in that area; associates found Brandon’s abandoned car in a ditch off a gravel road along the Lincoln County line a mile north of Highway 68.</p><p>Similalry, they brought the office of that county’s sheriff, Jack Vizecky, into the investigation; he informed the media that the Lumina had gotten hung up on the top of an incline at the edge of the road, not seriously enough to damage the car.</p><p>Except for that, there was nothing else found amiss with the car. Likewise, as the area was covered with grass and gravel, there were no tracks and, therefore, no way to tell what direction Brandon might have gone.</p><p>Seriously, the case still amazed many of us as Brandon is unknown whether he is dead or still alive. But we can feel the pain and sorrow of his parents and their hopes to get their son back.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=insight-on-brandon-swanson-age-and-parents></span>Insight On Brandon Swanson Age And Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brandon Swanson is well known for his missing case, which is still unsolved.
