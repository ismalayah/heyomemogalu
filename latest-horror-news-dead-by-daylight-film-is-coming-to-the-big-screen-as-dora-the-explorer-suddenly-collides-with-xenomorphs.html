The last several weeks have been absolutely monumental for the world of all things spooky, and it’s now become apparent that this momentum won’t be slowing down anytime soon — especially in the coming months ahead. As the eerie-verse prepares for the much-anticipated arrival of Scream VI next week, other pulse-pounding stories are as easily available to be explored and celebrated in today’s daily <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">horror</a></strong> roundup here at We Got This Covered. From a new Dead by Daylight adaptation to Dora the Explorer’s unexpected presence in the genre, there’s plenty of intriguing aspects to take a concrete look at.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>So, before you prematurely purchase your snacks for the premiere of Scream VI, feast your eyes on the latest news under the horror umbrella.</p><h2 id=h-dora-the-explorer-might-not-be-in-the-alien-remake-but-her-actress-will-be data-injectable=false>Dora the Explorer might not be in the Alien remake, but her actress will be</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PIEAPY5ZBBACTHZ5B2R4OJQHHE.jpg><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>In an unexpected twist of the century, The Evil Dead remake director Fede Álvarez has now apparently set his sights on launching the next chapter in the long-standing Alien franchise. And while most of the cast list are unsurprising names that have experience in the spooktacular catalog, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent announcement is leaving folks</a> absolutely dumbfounded. This relates to the casting of actress Isabela Merced, who is most known for portraying Dora the Explorer in an animated spinoff series. We certainly didn’t expect Dora’s name to be anywhere close to the horror genre, but we definitely won’t complain.</p><h2 id=h-ahead-of-scream-vi-ghostface-is-successfully-terrifying-folks-on-the-street data-injectable=false>Ahead of Scream VI, Ghostface is successfully terrifying folks on the street</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/scream-3-ghostface-e1674207639996.jpg><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>In one of the hottest marketing trends as of late, production house Paramount has sparked a stroke of genius by sprinkling a variety of Ghostface impersonators on streets around the U.S. The act was obviously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">done to create more promotion</a> for Scream VI, which is set to arrive in theaters next week. Of course, the hype around the slasher spectacle was high enough already, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to give Paramount (or Scream lovers) an extra boost of excitement.</p><h2 id=h-gamers-and-film-fanatics-are-set-to-merge-with-a-dead-by-daylight-movie-on-the-way data-injectable=false>Gamers and film fanatics are set to merge with a Dead by Daylight movie on the way</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dead-By-Daylight.jpg><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true>The year of 2023 just keeps getting better for horror — especially after the announcement of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blumhouse spearheading a live-action</a> Dead by Daylight movie. The upcoming project is sure to reunite gamers and film fanatics in unison, as both sides of the tracks will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath for the adaptation to be brought to life. Of course, seeing as the announcement was just recently made public, there has yet to be an official release date confirmed.
