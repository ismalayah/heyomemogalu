This is likely because in Boruto, Rock Lee and his wife are very minor characters in the series with an already large number of important characters.</p><h2 id=h-fan-theories-on-who-rock-lee-is-married-to data-injectable=false>Fan theories on who Rock Lee is married to</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>With a mystery like this, fans are left to theorize. One famous theory on who Rock Lee is married to is <strong>Tenten</strong>. There is an entire <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fandom article</a> out there attempting to prove that Tenten and Rock Lee are lovers and are just perfect for each other.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Speculations from fans discusses that throughout Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden, Tenten is the only female character that’s extremely close to Rock Lee, they fight together and learn from each other, which led many fans to actually ship them together before any of the Boruto stories even came out.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Further evidence that many fans bring up is an image in the end credit scene of Boruto: Naruto the movie where all couples are together with their respective offspring. And in this image, Rock Lee, Tenten, and Metal Lee can be seen next to each other.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>And lastly, many people point out that Metal Lee’s fighting style and technique is a near-perfect combination of both Tenten’s and Rock Lee’s fight style and technique. This then led to many believing that Tenten is married to Rock Lee and gave birth to their son, Metal Lee.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Another famous theory is that Rock Lee is married to great grand-daughter of the civil councilor Tsubaki and master Taijutsu user Azami. Azami is a character that was introduced in a filler arc whom — according to some fans — Lee supposedly married.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Though evidence to this theory being an actual fact is extremely scarce, the main reason many fans believe this is because Azami is also a master of the art of Taijutsu, a quality of which Rock Lee admired about her the most. Though they only met once when they were both young, it isn’t impossible that the two might’ve crossed paths again after the great ninja war in Naruto: Shippuden.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6s7vCpGSlnZViuqK%2B0aKcnWWkpHqzu8KkZKWdlah6uLXFnmSipl2XvLPB06hknrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./seth-rogen-clarifies-that-emma-watson-did-not-walk-off-the-set-of-this-is-the-end.html><span>←</span><span>Seth Rogen clarifies that Emma Watson DID NOT walk off the set of This Is The End</span></a>
