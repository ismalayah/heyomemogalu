It was briefly among his other eclectic possessions like a haunted home in New Orleans and the Shah of Iran’s Lamborghini before dying at 14 just recently and, as Cage said in a chat <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Wired for their series</a> “Answers the Web’s Most Searched Questions,” he had wanted an eagle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_2934-e1634572936387.jpg><p>“That was very strange. I had been having strange dreams about two-headed eagles and I … this is a true story, somebody contacted my agency and said ‘oh there is a person who found a two-headed snake in Norwalk. The next day, isn’t that weird?”</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Suddenly, him saying he is a goth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as he did</a> in January makes so much more sense than it did before. Aside from The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, the man with the menagerie will be on screen next in The Retirement Plan, The Old Way, Butcher’s Crossing, and Renfield next year, where he will play the infamous Count Dracula character. That piece is a dark fantasy-horror-comedy and will be a less serious take on the vampire than depictions previous.</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=93 data-injectable=false>If you happen to be in possession of a two-headed eagle, get in touch with Cage immediately.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S7qq%2FOpZisZZOWtKZ507CmZqCVlrGmsIyspZqjlWKxs7HApqpmmZKkwrV5xJqepZ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chante-adams.html><span>←</span><span>Chant Adams Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</span></a>
