The script, which is credited to James Hammett (reportedly a pseudonym for the novelist, who wasn’t happy with the director’s changes)&nbsp;reconfigures the source material&nbsp;as&nbsp;a more distanced and observant piece, with no voice-over but&nbsp;lots of scenes where we get to hang back and watch people talk and behave.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Last Shot movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2004)</h2><time>Jun 26, 2024</time>

The city is old and ominous. John struggles to raise a statue to its perch on a church wall, and then uncovers it to reveal a hideous gargoyle, sticking its tongue out at him. A church scaffold collapses beneath him. The hotel where the Baxters are staying is eager to close at the end of season; the lobby furniture is already shrouded. The canals yield drowned bodies.
