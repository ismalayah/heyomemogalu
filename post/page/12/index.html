Bocchi the Rock has the perfect recipe for success. Socially awkward girls who like to play guitar? Check. Queer representation? Check. Fantastic animation? Infinitely checked. I mean, it wouldn’t have become MyAnimeList’s highest-rated show during the Fall season of 2022 if it weren’t any good.

When the Fede Alvarez-helmed reboot of Sam Raimi’s beloved 1981 cult horror classic, Evil Dead, was first announced, many fans were awash with apprehension, and understandably so. However, when the 2013 remake, currently sitting at 62% on Rotten Tomatoes, actually came out, it left a lot of people pleasantly surprised. In fact, it actually had folks calling for a sequel.
