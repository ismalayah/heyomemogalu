It is important that both friends and enemies believe Shin-gen is alive; his appearance, or shadow, creates both the respect of his clan and the caution of his enemies. If he is unmasked, he is useless; as Shingen's double, he can send hundreds of men to be killed, and his own guards will willingly sacrifice their lives for him.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Taiwan Little League World Series team led by star Fan Chen-Jun</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>
