I’m Gina Mericle and I’m doing this fundraiser for my little brother (Michael Mericle). He was in a serious car accident last night around 8:00pm! He and 2 of his friends were just hanging out coming back from Walmart when they got into the serious accident! They were stuck under a Penske truck and it took them a little to get them out especially Michael he was the last one out of the car! He has severe injuries and a long recovery to come! If you can’t donate please share and keep all 3 of the boys in your prayers!!!❤️</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
