With ABC flying out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wells Adams</a> from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor In Paradise</a> to bartend, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Susan Noles</a> from The Golden Bachelor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to officiate</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathy Swarts</a> from The Golden Bachelor, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Lawson</a> from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelorette</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to serve as red carpet correspondents</a>, and more, anywhere from 100 to 150 people walked the “Gold Carpet” at the function, ultimately proving that The Golden Wedding was as extravagant as can be.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>Because of all of the glitz and glam that the evening had in store — which included a broadcast on live television with an elaborate team and camera crew to make it happen — anyone who tuned into The Golden Wedding had nothing but money on their mind. Given how expensive The Golden Wedding looked, fans of The Bachelor franchise might be wondering whether or not ABC paid for the function, as well as how much it cost altogether.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=72 data-injectable=false>Keep scrolling for the answer to these frequently asked questions…</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Did ABC pay for The Golden Wedding?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Golden-Wedding-4.png><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>As one can assume, ABC did pay for The Golden Wedding, from the ring to the dress to the venue and beyond.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Given that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nist has a net worth upwards of $500,000</a>, Turner was accused being a “gold digger” after introducing Theresa to his family as a “professional businesswoman” on The Golden Bachelor. Because of this, fans of The Bachelor franchise took to X — formerly known as Twitter — as soon as The Golden Wedding was announced, accusing the two lovebirds of agreeing to a televised wedding in order to have everything paid for by ABC.</p><p>“Gerry’s cheap a** knowing ABC will pay for the entire wedding if it’s televised.”</p><p>“Gerry tearing up thinking about all the money about to hit his bank account later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#GoldenBachelor</a>“</p><p>“The Golden Bachelor viewers liked season cuz Gerry seemed genuine. ABC/The Bachelor franchise tainted that by making the wedding a branding & money-making op. Wasn’t anything like real Gerry & Theresa. So staged & weird, worst of The Bachelor brand, instead of the authenticity of the couple. Shameful!”</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Not to mention ABC gifted Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist an all expenses paid trip to Italy that the duo is using as their honeymoon. The network is seriously hooking them up with all of their festivities as newlyweds!</p><h2 id=h-how-much-did-the-golden-wedding-cost data-injectable=false>How much did The Golden Wedding cost?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Golden-Wedding-3.png><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>While there is no way to know exactly how much The Golden Wedding cost, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> estimated how much money was spent on the special day, and it looks like it was a pretty penny…</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>For starters, Turner and Nist tied the knot at the La Quinta Resort & Club in La Quinta, California. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wedding Spot</a>&nbsp;it costs about $30,000 for the venue and outside vendors, but that is definitely not all that The Golden Wedding consisted of, with ABC also providing Theresa with a stunning wedding dress — likely worth thousands of dollars — as well as a dazzling Neil Lane diamond ring. After all, someone needs to pay for the floral arrangements, the live band, the wedding cake, and more!</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>To top it all off, given that a majority of the guests were members of Bachelor Nation — such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brayden Bowers and Christina Mandrell</a>, Kenny Braasch and Mari Pepin, Dean Unglert and Caelynn Miller-Keyes, and more — the network likely flew in each guest in for the wedding, including every single contestant from the inaugural season of The Golden Bachelor, resulting in thousands of dollars more in plane tickets and lodging alone.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>With all of this in mind, Showbiz Cheat Sheet predicted that The Golden Wedding cost the network hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. How wild is that?</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=false>Regardless of the cost, The Golden Wedding was a real treat! In case you missed it, fans of The Bachelor franchise can stream the one-of-a-kind event via Hulu or Disney Plus now to watch Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist — or should we say Theresa Turner? — tie the knot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yltcNmmJubXaWuunnFqKlmrJiaeqi7y52cp2WnmrGltc2gZJqmlGK1sMOMpqycoF2ZtqV5yK1knKejqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corrina-roppo-and-joey-roppo-from-dated-and-related-five-facts-to-know-about-2-406916-html.html><span>←</span><span>Corrina Roppo And Joey Roppo From Dated and Related: Five Facts To Know About</span></a>
