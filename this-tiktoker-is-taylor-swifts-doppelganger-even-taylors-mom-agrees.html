Of course, the social media star was wildly and visibly excited after receiving the comment from her idol and shouted in response, “I am legitimately crying and shaking right now! I love you!

Speaking about the album, she went on to say,</p><p>“We lie awake in love and fear, in turmoil and in tears. We stare at walls and drink until they speak back. We twist in our self-made cages and pray that we aren’t – right this minute – about to make some fateful life-altering mistake. This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams. The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching – hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve… we’ll meet ourselves”.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>After the incident, Leechin has attracted quite a lot of curiosity and further digging has revealed that the TikTok influencer went <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">viral for being Taylor’s look-alike</a> last year after she posted a video of her doing laundry to which one of her TikTok followers commented, “wait so you’re not Taylor Swift”? to which she replied, “No, I’m not”.
