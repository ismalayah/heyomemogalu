Recommended Videos We don’t always have such a stacked list of seasonal anime, but 2022 surely delivered. Chainsaw Man, Bocchi The Rock, Spy x Family, and Bleach were all released within the same period, and truth be told — we can only hope that 2024 will be as quality-dense as it was two years ago."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Considering the immense popularity this seinen series has garnered, it is almost a given that a continuation should follow, but that might not come until 2025. At the moment, Bocchi the Rock’s director, Keiichiro Saitō, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has his hands full with Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</a>, and also, with the upcoming film duology expected for summertime.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Oh, wait, you didn’t know? Well, yes, Bocchi the Rock‘s second season may not be here anytime soon, but a double feature will be hitting the cinemas during Spring and Summer. That’s right, Cloverworks will be launching two compilation movies, the first one releasing in Spring 2024, and the second following in the Summer. They will showcase the best moments of the first season, and perhaps give a glimpse of what’s to come.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>At this time, all we can do is wait, and perhaps compulsively re-watch the first season time and time again on Crunchyroll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmasmJq%2FpnnGqKCnn12pvG6uxGaZqJuTnbZuwMeeZKunk6B6tLHArKanZWJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tatiana-chavez-video-went-viral-for-all-the-wrong-reasons.html><span>←</span><span>Tatiana Chavez Video What Is The Viral Footage All About?</span></a>
