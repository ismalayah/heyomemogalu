While we’re yet to see any footage or images of the actor in character as the Merc with the Mouth’s cyborg frenemy, we at least know what kind of hair he’ll be sporting&nbsp;in the role now.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>The actor posted a photo of himself with his son, Trevor Brolin, on his <a href=#>Instagram account</a>&nbsp;a few days ago. Though it has nothing to do with&nbsp;Deadpool 2,&nbsp;it’s relevant as&nbsp;we know that Brolin is currently prepping for the project and as such, we can work out that his haircut here is the one he’ll have&nbsp;in the movie. Minus dyeing it white to match the character on the page, of course.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>As fans will recognize, the ‘do is very similar to Cable’s look in some of the comic stories – shaved at the sides with the long front slicked back. Though he isn’t in costume yet and doesn’t have a prosthetic cyborg eye attached to his face, Brolin is definitely&nbsp;beginning to look the part.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19051810_1871237286533759_6980277804050939904_n.jpg alt width=1080 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, it may be a while before we get any official photos of Brolin in character as Cable, as the actor is currently working on a completely different superhero movie for a whole other franchise. Namely,&nbsp;<a href=#>Avengers: Infinity War</a>,&nbsp;the upcoming effort&nbsp;from Marvel Studios. Brolin’s been playing the overarching villain Thanos via motion capture since 2014’s&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;and the Mad Titan will finally make his presence known to Earth’s Mightiest Heroes before the big showdown in the currently untitled&nbsp;Avengers 4.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Earlier in the year</a>, it was reported that&nbsp;<strong>Deadpool 2</strong>&nbsp;was scheduled to start filming on June 19th. So keep an eye out for some set photos and videos, as they should start to surface online ahead of the sequel’s June 1st, 2018 release date.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=false>If you can’t wait until then to see Brolin in action again, you’ll be able to catch him the month before that in the aforementioned&nbsp;Infinity War, which arrives on May 4th, 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooairmGKvs7vLoqVmm5GXuaZ5x5qgq5ulqXqlscCdp6innGJ%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sienna-hollen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-221636-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sienna Hollen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
