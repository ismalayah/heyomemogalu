To say Henry Cavill was a perfect casting choice for Netflix’s acclaimed The Witcher series is an understatement, to say the least.
Recommended Videos Despite already having the perfect physique and physical fitness required to portray Geralt of Rivia thanks, in part, to his Superman commitments, Cavill has spoken to great length about his own love of Andrzej Sapkowski’s creation and the subsequently massively popular video games it spawned. CD Projekt RED’s The Witcher 3 is often considered to not only be one of this decade’s best games but one of the best of all time as well thanks to its technical mastery and deep, intriguing narrative.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Latest Yellowstone News: Luke Grimes and Kelsey Asbille on the good, bad, and (not) ugly in Ye</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../simpsons-review-white-christmas-blues.html></a>
Recommended Videos The Simpsons&nbsp;has a long, proud history of Christmas specials, from “Grift of the Magi” (the one with Funzo), “Skinner’s Sense of Snow” (the one where the kids are trapped at school), and “‘Tis the Fifteenth Season” (the one where Homer realizes his holiday selfishness). Heck, even the first ever episode of The Simpsons was a Christmas special, “The Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire.” Of course, this opens up an interesting paradox since the Simpsons themselves never age and they’ve had about 14 different Christmases.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Know how a pharmacists son became a billionaire!

The Ochoas&nbsp;live and work in&nbsp;a city with nine million people but only 45 government-operated ambulances. Their&nbsp;ambulance is&nbsp;nominally run by a father,&nbsp;Fer, who has health problems and seems profoundly&nbsp;depressed (some of the film's most haunting images are silent&nbsp;closeups of his face lost in thought). But the real boss is Fer's 17-year old son Juan, who usually takes the lead in treating patients, dealing with finances and official regulations, and arguing with cops who hassle them in hopes of shaking loose a bribe.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Young Adult movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2011)</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>

Patton Oswalt is, in a way, the key to the film's success. Theron is flawless at playing a cringe-inducing monster and Wilson touching as a nice guy who hates to offend her, but the audience needs a point of entry, a character we can identify with, and Oswalt's Matt is human, realistic, sardonic and self-deprecating. He speaks truth to Mavis.
Though he's had many supporting parts, this is only Oswalt's second major role; he was wonderful a few years ago in "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Eduardo Verastegui</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>

Chris is in rebellion against the isolated life created for them by their father John (Dermot Mulroney). So is Tim (Devon Allen), but in an internal way, expressed by the peculiar things he eats and the chronic stomach pain that results. When their uncle Deel (Josh Lucas) appears, he is at first a welcome change, with his laid-back permissiveness. John asks Deel to watch the kids during the day while he's at work, but Deel is not very good at this, and points his nephews toward more trouble than he saves them from.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What are Daemonculaba in Warhammer 40,000?</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>

Genetic manipulation is nothing new in Warhammer 40,000, but one faction takes it to new levels of barbarity. The Chapters of Chaos have always had a problem attracting new recruits.
