And while Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie is arguably looking like the Ragnarok newcomer with the most prominent future in the saga, a comparable number of hearts were won over by Korg the Kronan, voiced by director Taika Waititi himself</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bradley Cooper Holds Hands With Daughter Lea at 'Maestro' Premiere</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>
