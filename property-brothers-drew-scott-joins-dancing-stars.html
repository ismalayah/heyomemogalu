Lucky for him, his dancing partner is none other than pro Emma Slater, winner of the previous season.</p><p>And the pair have apparently already been hard at work, practicing their dance moves. "We've actually done two rehearsals," Scott told the morning show. "I'm an athletic guy, I'm a sporty guy and I like taking on a challenge, but I've never danced before. And she is the best. She won last season. So I want to make it my duty to get her a second mirror ball."</p><p>But Scott and Slater's enthusiasm for the upcoming season doesn't come without some hurdles—primarily, Scott's height. "His height is going to be the most challenging thing," Slater explained to GMA. "He's got these long arms, long legs and there's about a foot difference between the two of us. So I have to wear my shoes every rehearsal or else my hair whips him in the face."</p><p>As GMA previously announced (via <a href=#>ABC News</a>), Slater's fellow dancers Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Peta Murgatroyd, Val Chmerkovskiy, Emma Slater, Lindsay Arnold, Witney Carson, Artem Chigvintsev, Keo Motsepe, Gleb Savchenko, Sharna Burgess, Alan Bersten, and Mark Ballas will all return for the upcoming season of DWTS.</p><p>The dancing competition show returns to ABC on Monday, Sept. 18. But fans don't need to wait that long for more DWTS news. The season's full celebrity lineup is scheduled to be announced on GMA on Wednesday, Sept. 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWtiaIZwvNGop56qpK56o77OrZ%2BeqqNisbOx1maqnKekqXqru8inqmackaOwqrrGZqqtmaKofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./betty-moffitt.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Was Billie Jean King's Mother, Betty Moffitt At The Time Of Her Death?</span></a>
