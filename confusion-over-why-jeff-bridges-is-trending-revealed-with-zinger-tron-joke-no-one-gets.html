Of his most memorable performances, he has played Jack Prescott in the 1976 make of King Kong, Terry Brogan in the 1984 romance Against All Odds, The Dude in the 1998 comedy The Big Lebowski, and of course, Kevin Flynn in the 1982 film Tron as well as 2010’s TRON: Legacy.</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>Today’s confusion lies in the role he played in Tron and what he had to say about it when he was recently on The Hollywood Reporter Roundtables with Kieran Culkin (Succession), Damson Idris (Snowfall&nbsp;and&nbsp;Swarm), Michael Imperioli (The White Lotus), Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Mandalorian), and Evan Peters (Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story).

When someone’s trending, one of the first thoughts is “Did he die” or the mad rush to find out if it’s a hoax that someone rumored he was dead.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jeff Bridges is 73.<br>So, when I saw the actor trending on Twitter this morning, I had to double check that he is OK.<br>Who else? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/G0d4v0kMjF</a></p>— Marcio Delgado (@marcio_delgado) <a href=#>May 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Adding to the trend are all the fans who are clueless over why but are more than willing to add to the conversation with their admiration for the actor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jeff Bridges.

They congratulate him on the role he played in Tron and then continue talking while the joke lingered meaninglessly above their heads. Here’s what Jeff Bridges said when Pedro Pascal was talking about trying to play the video game based on the series he starred in The Last of Us.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Despite my already extensive admiration for Jeff Bridges I would not have guessed at his ability to land a perfect Norm Macdonald-style wisecrack, delivery and all. <a href=#>https://t.co/wXJFMbmOnw</a></p>— Mac Rogers (@macwrites) <a href=#>May 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>For fans who may not have gotten the joke either, here is a visual image of what it’s about.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jeff Bridges actually remembered the plot points of TRON!

In the plot for Tron, Jeff Bridges’ character literally gets sucked into the video game. Why it went over everyone’s head is hard to guess, but the fans didn’t miss it at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SwsLrFrqqip55ivLex0WauobFdn7KnsoybqaKcl5rAbrXSZqurnZ6Ztq%2BzjKucr52RobKledaiq6Flqp67qLHRZqurp55it7C3xGalqGWfo7Jus8Stqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chad-wheeler-age-wiki-biography-girlfriend-alleah-instagram-pictures-seattle-seahawks-nfl-player-arrested.html><span>←</span><span>Chad Wheeler Age, Wiki, Biography Girlfriend Alleah Instagram, Pictures: Seattle Seahawks NFL Player</span></a>
