As you can see in these screenshots, she looks very comfortable with her body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Wearing a floral skirt to contrast with the simple white crop top, the The Bachelorette alum shared her exhilaration in her TikTok caption.</p><p>“I have waited my entire life to wear this top!!!” Rachel wrote.</p><p>This is not the first time that Rachel has discussed how much her previous breast size limited her wardrobe and impeded her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In fact, Rachel has been considering getting a breast reduction since she was only 17 years old.</p><p>“I feel like I spent all of my teenage years and my early 20s just really trying to hide my body,” she admitted on TikTok ahead of her surgery.</p><p>Rachel then explained: “That’s why a lot of the time you guys would see me very covered up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I would always try on dresses or outfits with [Bachelor franchise stylist Cary Fetman],” Rachel recalled.</p><p>“And,” she continued, “I remember always being like, ‘You know, when I get my boobs done I can wear this.'”</p><p>Rachel added: “And I got to the point where I have so many tops and bras and just bathing suits that are saved for when I get this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Then, Rachel explained “because I didn’t know when it was.”</p><p>“But,” she went on, “all I knew was one day I was gonna get it.”</p><p>Rachel affirmed “and I was gonna be wearing little tops.” And now she is!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sometimes, cosmetic surgery is primarily a product of public pressure or societal norms. In those cases, it can feel like a tragedy — especially when someone begins wanting it when they are only 17 years old.</p><p>Breast reduction is a bit of a special case.</p><p>Because breast reduction can be a purely medical procedure. And also because social pressures sort of go both ways on this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The increased sexualization — where everything that you wear or do receives creepy attention from creepy people — is a major downside to larger breasts.</p><p>So in a sense, someone who is very busty might feel pressured to go down a few sizes. Why? Just to avoid some weirdos and their comments.</p><p>Of course, those same creeps will have a normal one about breast reduction. There are men who “joke” about holding vigils for a woman’s breasts when she undergoes a reduction. It’s kind of horrifying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And, as we said, it’s also just a huge medical issue. Not the same as a mastectomy for cancer, and not the same as top surgery for trans folks.</p><p>Larger breasts can have medical consequences. Those include back problems and more.</p><p>Most importantly, Rachel did this to make herself happier. And she is clearly happier. Good for her!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WBcL7AnJ%2BepF2nsqSvx6KYZpuVobKjvsCtnKxlkqeyor%2FTZqmenKWYwaq7zWaqrqqXmr%2B6ecinZJplk6e8sXnTqKdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chlo-c3-ab-grace-moretz.html><span>←</span><span>Chlo Grace Moretz movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
