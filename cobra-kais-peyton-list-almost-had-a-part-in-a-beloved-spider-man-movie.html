But it set her on the right path, and she quickly landed successful gigs on TV shows like “All My Children”&nbsp;and other films like “27 Dresses.” And while her role in “Spider-Man 2” ended up on the cutting room floor, it wouldn’t be the last time she had a chance to star in a Spidey project.</p><p>10 years after “Spider-Man 2”&nbsp;came out, List had a voiceover role in the animated series “Ultimate Spider-Man” where she plays Emma Ross in the Season 3 episode, “Halloween Night at the Museum”&nbsp;– yes, the same Emma Ross List also played in the Disney Channel series, “Jessie,” where she made a name for herself. The animated episode is a crossover between “Ultimate Spider-Man” and the live-action show where Spidey (Drake Bell) needs the “Jessie” characters’ help in defeating Morgan Le Fey (Grey Griffin).</p><p>List also has experience on the DC side of things, as in 2019, she voiced Batgirl in the animated movie “Batman: Hush.”&nbsp;Still, she’s due for another shot at appearing in a live-action superhero movie. List got absolutely ripped for “Cobra Kai,” so she already has the physique and a good deal of training for the fight scenes required of such films, and she would make a pretty good live-action Gwen Stacy if the movies ever go down that route.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cK%2FOm6maZZuWtrR5z56wraeeYrmqv9NmmKWln6jBbrTAnWSaZaCWv7V5yKdkmmWSmrmwwsSdZKyomZmys3nMmqVmpZ%2BrtqZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruce-springsteen-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Bruce Springsteen Net Worth How Rich is Springsteen in 2023?</span></a>
