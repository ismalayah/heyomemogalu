It’s pretty intense.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true><strong>LL</strong>: The challenge and the people. I’ve never really done a challenging role like this before, so I really wanted to face it. Definitely having Clive, Catherine and Viola involved with it was definitely a plus, because I’ve always wanted to work with people like that. And David, of course.</p><p data-characters=34 data-current-count=34 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: How was David as a director?</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: He was great. Him being an actor as well was very helpful. He was aware of how much time and effort it takes to really get to that emotional place. So, he’s very sensitive about that and a very personable person. He’s very open to you about talking about anything.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: You mentioned between scenes things would get kind of light. Do you have any moments that come to mind?</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: Oh yeah. I don’t remember what we were laughing about, but there was a moment out of the dinner table scene where Clive and I were laughing so hard that he couldn’t look at me during the scene. I had to hide behind the camera and he had to look at a piece of tape on the lens. We couldn’t do it. We were laughing so hard.</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: How has your online activity changed since you started filming the movie?</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: It’s changed a lot. I never really knew much about this kind of situation or anything. It definitely opened my eyes more. I’m more cautious, because I have friends who add mutual friends on facebook. I used to think that that was ok. Now, it’s like” nope”.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=1122898_trust_03 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/1122898_trust_03-540x360.jpg width=540 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: Speaking of friends, there was a part where’s Annie’s friend goes behind her back to a counselor as a sort of intervention. Have you ever or would you ever do something like that?</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: There are a lot of messages in this film and that is definitely one. I’ve never personally done it before, but I do believe that if you truly care about someone’s safety that you would risk the friendship.</p><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: What kind of movies do you like?</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true><strong>LL</strong>: I love all kinds of movies. I love a really good comedy and not the cheesy ones. My parents hate this, but I love horror films. Those are my favorite and of course, dramatic roles. I’m really drawn to those as well. All different genres.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: What you’ve done up till now has been pretty dramatic. Would you like to do a comedy? When do you get to be a kid?</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: I’ve never really had a good opportunity to do something like that. So, I’m thinking the right time will come along and a really good comedy comes around. I’d totally do it. I’d like to do something with kids my age, something like that.</p><p data-characters=34 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: Like High School Musical 12?</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: (laughs) I was thinking of something more along the lines of<strong> Stand by Me</strong>. Something heartfelt and cute. That would be fun. I loved that movie.</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Did you do any research for your role as Annie?</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true><strong>LL</strong>: Well, David’s part of the Rape Foundation. I was able to go there when they were holding the fundraiser. I went there and listened to a girl close to my age and listened to her experience of being raped. That really, really touched me and got me closer to my character. Along with reading articles and things like that, I went to the Rape Treatment center in Santa Monica and was able to get a feel of where victims go to get all the evidence and also where they get therapy and everything.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=6a00e54f9153e088330147e29cb931970b-800wi alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/6a00e54f9153e088330147e29cb931970b-800wi-540x360.jpg width=540 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Has the role made you sensitive to what parents go through on a daily basis?</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: I realized how hard it is, because there’s a big balance to evetything. You want to monitor everything your kids do, but you also have to give them their own privacy as well. So, I have a lot of sympathy for my parents especially.</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: What was it like having both your screen parents and your real parents on set?</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: My parents are very understanding. I need to put all of my heart and I have to focus on what I’m doing. So, it’s really hard to have your parents in your eyeline when you’re trying to talk to your stage parents. So they were always downstairs or in my trailer. If I needed them, they were always there for me. They made it really easy for me to focus on my work.</p><p data-characters=32 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: So what do you do for fun?</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: I hang out with my friends. I go on bike rides when the weather is nice. I have a really good, solid group of friends.</p><p data-characters=48 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: How do they react to you being a big star?</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true><strong>LL</strong>: They’re actually really funny about it. <strong>Trust</strong> is coming into the theater we go to a lot, so the posters are up there and the trailer’s constantly playing. So, my friends want to get a big group together and go. They’re going to drag me with them. I think that’ll be fun. They’re very supportive.</p><p data-characters=46 data-current-count=46 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Now, do you live in California or Texas?</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: We live out here. We have a house. We lived in an apartment complex for about five years and we just moved last year. We were back and forth for two years from California to Texas.</p><p data-characters=28 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Do you prefer it here?</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true><strong>LL</strong>: I can’t say. Honestly, it’s kind of equal. All of my family is in Texas. Of course, I miss my house in Galveston. I got a nice beach house and everything, but I have a really good second family here.</p><p data-characters=34 data-current-count=34 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: What are you working on now?</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false><strong>LL</strong>: I just finished a movie with Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman called <strong>Trespass</strong> and we’re hoping for that to come out in the fall.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Sounds good. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us and good luck with everything.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Be sure to check out Trust when it hits theatres on April 1 and follow the film on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.
