This, in turn, grants everyone who ends up there equal superpowers…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/what-if-kahhori-1.png><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>…until Kahorri joins them as apart from gaining the blessing to never age, she also ends up being ultra powerful – faster, stronger, and with the ability to manipulate gravity. In true hero fashion, she motivates the Mohawk people residing in the dimension to return to their village and saves her people from the ruthless soldiers of Queen Isabella of Spain.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>So, how did Marvel preserve the cultural ethnicity of its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new, original superhero</a> — yep, there is no Kahhori nor someone like Kahorri in the comic books? Well, not only did they hire language expert Cecelia King to perfect the dialogues in the Mohawk language (which is almost the entire episode), but also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cast Mohawk actress</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Devery Jacobs</strong></a> in the role.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-devery-jacobs-and-why-on-earth-did-i-say-double-debut-in-the-headline data-injectable=false>Who is Devery Jacobs (and why on Earth did I say “double debut” in the headline?)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Devery-Jacobs-in-Reservation-Dogs.jpg><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>While Jacobs is very new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, she has been on the Hollywood map for more than a decade now.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Most of you will remember her as the lead character, Elora, in FX’s Reservation Dogs, which recently wrapped up its three-season run in September 2023. But not before it acquired widespread critical acclaim, especially Jacobs who was nominated for a Gotham Award and a Critics Choice Award for her exceptional performance as one of the four Indigenous teenagers who made up the show’s Rez Dogs gang living in rural Oklahoma.</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Netflix’s canceled series The Order also saw Jacobs in the significant recurring character of Lilith Bathory, the short-tempered member of the Knights. 2019 also saw her in American Gods, as the “two-spirited” Sam Crow. My introduction to Jacobs’ unique and impressive acting was sadly 2018’s The Lie, which barely gave her screen time and despite flaunting to be one, it failed to qualify as a horror flick, playing it fast and loose with the term “film.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>But safe to say, the rest of the actress’ resume more than makes up for it — This Place, Backspot, Rhymes for Young Ghouls, Bootlegger… you take your pick.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>As for her MCU entry, well, the ardent watchers of What If…? season 2 have already heard her voice as Kahhori… and will be soon seeing her in the Marvel series, Echo, as Bonnie. While the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suspicious ongoing trajectory</a> of the animated series and the note the sixth episode ends on strong suggests Kahhori might have a live-action MCU future after all, not much is known or can be guessed about her Bonnie in Echo. All we know at this point is that the character is “resilient and strong-willed.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>While her debut as Kahhori has gone smoothly, it remains to be seen whether her Bonnie will manage to have a similar impact in the series Echo, which is already trying to deflect <a href=#>dire predictions of its future</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGagkauybsXOrmSsnZWjeqWx1Z6psmWalrCwrtJmq6GdXZawtb7ErKpmmZyherSx02arqGWdlrimecBmm6itkqGybrnCrmSdnZKqwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scream-fans-can-now-stay-in-the-original-movies-iconic-house-for-halloween.html><span>←</span><span>Scream Fans Can Now Stay In The Original Movies Iconic House For Halloween</span></a>
