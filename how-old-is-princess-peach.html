While it isn’t commonly broadcast in the franchise, there is some indication of how old Peach may be.</p><h2 id=h-princess-peach-s-age-explained data-injectable=false>Princess Peach’s age, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/princess-peach-anya-taylor-joy.png><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">information available</a> on the net, Peach is believed to have been 15 years old during her first appearance in the Mario franchise. However, in more modern appearances she is depicted to be in her mid-20s, likely around 25. For instance, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, it isn’t clear exactly how old they intended Peach to be, but it does seem like she is at least in her 20s.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>When Peach’s age was first being speculated about, it raised some serious eyebrows in the gaming community given the age of her rescuer, Mario. He is depicted to be in his mid-20s, according to creator <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>. Many are unclear as to whether that is his actual age. Suspicions were heightened further because of Mario’s elderly appearance, and the fact that he’s been referred to in the past as an “old dude” by Miyamoto.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>Putting all that aside, it is likely that Princess Peach is now in her mid-20s, though given the history of Nintendo withholding specific details of their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iconic characters</a>, we may never know for sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZon6ivXaS5pXnIrGSpqpmjsKa%2F0mannpmTnXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tobias-lutke-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-145939-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tobias Ltke Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
