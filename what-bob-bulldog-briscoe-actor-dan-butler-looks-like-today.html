His most recent film at the time of writing was 2022’s “Blonde.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOsJ%2BarF2XvKN5wa6jpZyfnHqjvsismqidXZawtbvRZpuapl2XwrW4xKtkpaefoMBuuMiknGasn5muuns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-the-mummy-4-releasing-in-2025-and-will-it-star-brendan-fraser-the-rumors-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Is The Mummy 4 releasing in 2025 and will it star Brendan Fraser?
