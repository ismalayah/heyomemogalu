The Butcher of Blaviken was a formidable fighter, with Cavill really flexing his power and combat skills in the role. Now, his already much-maligned replacement, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Hemsworth</a>, has to find a way to keep up with him.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>One individual who worked with Cavill on the series was Netflix’s One Piece director Mark Jobst, who directed the series’ penultimate and final episode of the first season, Before a Fall and Much More. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent interview with We Got This Covered</a>, the director praised Cavill’s fighting ability and how it allowed them to tell the story through the action sequences.</p><p>“When you get into something like&nbsp;The Witcher&nbsp;where I had a lot of big fight sequences in the pilot on the sword fight, I wanted to do a very big, long continuous action sequence in that, in order to tell the story that the Witcher is a really good fighter, and be bloody careful if you take him on because he can really do this. And we could do that because Henry Cavill is a really bloody good fighter.”</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Being set in a medieval fantasy world, there is of course a lot of sword fighting, and Cavill’s deftness with a sword certainly came in handy, “When he wields that sword, man, you better know what you’re doing, because it’s heavy, and he won’t stop. And that was really exciting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Witcher-Henry-Cavill.jpg><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Many fans felt that Cavill was perfect for the role, not only because he physically fits the role of a super-powered fighter, a role he has played more than once, but also because of his love for the source material and world-building <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">created by Andrzej Sapkowski</a>. Despite Cavill being the face of the series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he and The Witcher parted ways</a>. With the story left unfinished, Netflix had no alternative but to replace him, bringing on board the younger brother of Thor, Liam Hemsworth.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>When the news was released that Hemsworth would be taking over the role, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the internet immediately and collectively released its rage</a>. You have to feel a little sorry for Hemsworth, who has yet to even prove whether or not he can take on the challenge, but for many, there is no replacing Cavill.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Though Hemsworth has been in plenty of action films himself, earning his breakout performance in The Hunger Games opposite Jennifer Lawrence as well as a number of other action films, he will really have his work cut out for him as he steps into the very large shoes left to him by Cavill.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>With the ongoing strikes, there is no date yet set for the fourth season of The Witcher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1prrRsmScmaaeua15yKxkmmWimq6tuNhmmaWnn5nGbrPOqJtmnpmctbWx0WajopmdYrWmudKwpqusmGK1or%2BMoaCsZaekv6x5wq6rZqelqXquscCsrKuhnpx6tryMraZmrJiaeri105yfnqpdqMGivtJmoKebopqxqq7LnmSam6SevK95xZ6Yratf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./d-c-cab-1983.html><span>←</span><span>D.
