To promote it, as well as give super fans a present for their dedication, Airbnb, Paramount and Spyglass Media has made it possible for lucky fans to stay the night in Stu Macher’s (Matthew Lillard) house from the first film. Not only that, fans will be led through the night by none other than Dewey Riley himself, David Arquette!</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>While the house is in California, original <strong>Scream</strong> screenwriter Kevin Williamson has made another exciting event for those fans who can’t travel to the house. It will be an online experience called, “Secrets to Scream” and is an all-access backstage pass. Fans will get both behind-the-scenes secrets of the original film and a few new ones if they’re lucky enough, of course. Such secrets, as Williamson says, are things only he knows, so you won’t get them from anywhere else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gallery-7-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gallery-1-2-scaled.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gallery-2-3.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gallery-6-1-e1642734161707.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gallery-3-2.jpeg><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>If living inside Stu’s house for the night isn’t enough for you, perhaps the fact that all proceeds benefiting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Trevor Project</a> foundation will be. Airbnb has decided to make a one-time donation to Ween Dream, an organization that, in the spirit of Halloween, provides free costumes to children in need. However, after that, 100% of the proceeds will go towards The Trevor Project and its mission of lowering suicide rates among LGBTQ+ teens.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>From details in the house such as Ghostface’s knife marks to the infamous brick phone, there are plenty of Easter eggs for super fans to find and gawk over during their stay.
