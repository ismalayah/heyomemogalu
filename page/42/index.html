The movie's attitude is commendable. It's actually trying to have fun with material that should be fun, and it's also actively making fun of the pieces that are worthy of mockery. It's as innocent in its approach to all of this as a movie that features the destruction of several planets can be, too.
The effort is often obvious, and that means a good number of the jokes are funnier on a theoretical level than they are on a practical one.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Apple TV+'s Land of Women is Pretty and Pleasant | TV/Streaming</h2><time>May 7, 2024</time>

With its premise firmly in place, “Land of Women” hits the notes you can expect from an Eva Longoria joint—romance and capers. As such, it’s pretty satisfying in the way the genre can be, hitting well-worn beats with aplomb. There’s beautiful scenery here, intergenerational learning there, poisoning here, and&nbsp;furtive glances there.

Before there were any holes in the ground, any Hobbits in the four farthings of the Shire, or any legendarium detailing the creation of the fictional world of Eä, where Middle-earth is located, J.R.R. Tolkien was first and foremost fascinated with the construction of languages. In fact, one could argue that The Lord of the Rings originally started as a figment of the lore the British author was trying to come up with for his new language.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>We now know the real reason why a Marvel crossover with Star Wars has never happened</h2><time>May 7, 2024</time>
