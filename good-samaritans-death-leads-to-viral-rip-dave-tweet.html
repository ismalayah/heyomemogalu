When I was in like 3rd grade, I went with my mom while she dropped some drugs off (yes, she was). Anyways. She left me in the car. This guys comes out to “watch” me and it’s just me and him. He looks over and asks. “You don’t know what a haiku is, do you?”</p>— Jessie Renee (@jreneebad) <a href=#>August 31, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>“You don’t know what a haiku is, do you?” he said. Jessie, who had recently written one for her class responded, “yeah, it’s a traditional Japanese poem consisting of 3 lines and in the pattern of 5-7-5 syllables.”</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>The man, Dave, was impressed.

On that day he vowed to make sure I always made it to school. My mother was in her own world, doing and dealing drugs. When I tell you this guy drove me and picked me up so he KNEW I went everyday.. he literally did my homework with me.</p>— Jessie Renee (@jreneebad) <a href=#>August 31, 2022</a><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Dave became, according to Jessie, “the closest thing to a father figure I’ve ever had.” He became a mentor, protector, and even a best friend to her.

I was not expecting anyone to even see this, but I am so so happy everyone knows how amazing he was. I will continue to fight and be a Dave in my life. And I pray that I can change someone’s life like he changed mine. ❤️</p>— Jessie Renee (@jreneebad) <a href=#>September 1, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>“You can have a good life in spite of your mom, or a bad 1 bc of her” Dave told her.
