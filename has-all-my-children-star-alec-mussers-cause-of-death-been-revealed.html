The announcement was made via the Instagram account of Musser’s fiancee, Paige Press.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=845 data-injectable=true>By any metric, Musser had an unusual career in show business. Starting out as a model for companies like Abercrombie and Fitch, he didn’t land his first onscreen credit until he was already in his 30s. Nabbing a spot on the second season of the reality competition I Wanna Be a Soap Star in 2005, he took home the grand prize: A 13-week contract on All My Children, playing the long-absent Del Henry. His contract was extended, and Musser stayed on the show into 2007, appearing in 43 episodes.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>In the years that followed, acting gigs became sparse. Musser picked up bit parts on the 2009 Jaleel White web series Road to the Altar, the Lifetime sitcom Rita Rocks, and a memorable scene in the 2010 comedy Grown Ups. Grown Ups star and producer Adam Sandler described Musser as “a wonderful, funny good man” and “a true great sweetheart of a person” in an Instagram post mourning the actor’s passing.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>The first few days of 2024 have been unusually hard for fans of daytime soap operas.
