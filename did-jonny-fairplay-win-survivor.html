Feeling bad for the broken-up Fairplay who wanted more details of his grandmother’s demise, the other players threw the competition so he could spend time with his buddy.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>When Fairplay and Dan were together alone, they laughed and laughed — Fairplay’s grandma wasn’t dead.

Nope.

In fact, he was the final player to be voted out. This was back when only two contestants would sit in front of the jury and endure a grilling in the hope of winning $1 million. Unfortunately for Fairplay, he was taken out at the final three.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Lillian Morris, a 51-year-old Scout troop leader, won the final Immunity Challenge of the season. By doing so, she secured her spot in the final Tribal Council, and she also had the power to choose who sat beside her. As history has it, Lillian voted Fairplay out, making way for Sandra Diaz-Twine to win her first season.</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>That wasn’t the last time Fairplay competed on Survivor.</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=874 data-injectable=false>He appeared on season 16’s Micronesia: Fans vs. Favorites in 2008 alongside nine other returning veterans and 10 rookie castaways. But, Fairplay’s game ended at the first Tribal Council when he told the rest of his tribemates that he was missing his family back home and was checked out of the game. When it was time to vote, every returnee wrote Fairplay’s name down and his second campaign for the grand prize was over, and that was the last time we saw him on Survivor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yltcNmoaimnq56p63Iq6elmalixKq6jKysq66Zq7yzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./disclosures-caracal-album-art-release-date.html><span>←</span><span>Disclosures Caracal Gets Album Art And Release Date</span></a>
